[vm]
# If a workload mostly uses anonymous memory and it hits this limit, the entire
# working set is buffered for I/O, and any more write buffering would require
# swapping, so it's time to throttle writes until I/O can catch up.  Workloads
# that mostly use file mappings may be able to use even higher values.
#
# The generator of dirty data starts writeback at this percentage (system default
# is 20%)
dirty_bytes = 20%

# Start background writeback (via writeback threads) at this percentage (system
# default is 10%)
dirty_background_bytes = 6%

[disk]
# The default unit for readahead is KiB.  This can be adjusted to sectors
# by specifying the relevant suffix, eg. (readahead => 8192 s). There must
# be at least one space between the number and suffix (if suffix is specified).
# readahead=>4096 (tuned default)

[sysctl]
# The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move
# processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk.
# 0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory
# for as long as possible
# 100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory
# and move them to swap cache
vm.swappiness=100

# The default kernel value 128 was over twenty years old default,
# kernel-5.4 increased it to 4096, thus do not have it lower than 2048
# on older kernels
net.core.somaxconn=>2048
