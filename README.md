zcore-bootc images are still in beta , dont use them rn. ( release 1 is planned for 26/2/2026)

TO-DO:
1. complete NVIDIA unified script + implement it.
2. remove bloat + better stack of default packages + replace ( free/restricted ) stuff with (freeworld/nonfree)
3. downstream plymouth theme ?
4. downstream brew ?
5. downstream devtools/devpackages ?
6. make it more minimal (remove any extra/not-needed-to boot) things ?
7. move to negativo17 codecs ?
8. add adios/bore scheduler ?
9. switch to cachyos/zen kernel ?
10. ship zodium-kde as part of zcore as zcore-kinoite (can be done but might over-complicate stuff )??
